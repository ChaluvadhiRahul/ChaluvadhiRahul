Let's go through the C++ program step by step and explain each part of it:

#include <iostream> and #include <string>: These are preprocessor directives that include necessary C++ standard library headers. <iostream> is used for input/output operations, and <string> is used for string manipulation.

std::string reverseString(const std::string& input): This line declares a function named reverseString that takes a constant reference to a string (const std::string& input) as input and returns a string (std::string). The function is responsible for reversing the input string.

std::string reverseString(const std::string& input) { ... }: This curly brace indicates the beginning of the function definition. Everything between the opening and closing curly braces constitutes the function's body.

std::string reversed;: This line declares an empty string variable called reversed, which will be used to store the reversed string.

for (int i = input.length() - 1; i >= 0; --i) { ... }: This is a for loop that iterates through the characters of the input string in reverse order. The loop starts with i initialized to the last index of the input string (input.length() - 1) and goes until i becomes 0.

reversed += input[i];: Inside the for loop, we append each character from the input string, starting from the last character (input[i]), to the reversed string.

return reversed;: After the for loop completes, the reversed string is returned from the function.

int main() { ... }: This is the main function where the program execution starts.

std::string inputString;: This line declares an empty string variable called inputString, which will store the user's input string.

std::cout << "Enter a string: ";: This line prints the message "Enter a string: " to the console, prompting the user to enter a string.

std::getline(std::cin, inputString);: This line reads the entire line of input entered by the user (including spaces) and stores it in the inputString variable.

std::string reversedString = reverseString(inputString);: This line calls the reverseString function, passing the user's input string as an argument. The reversed string is returned and stored in the reversedString variable.

std::cout << "Reversed string: " << reversedString << std::endl;: Finally, the program prints the reversed string to the console, preceded by the message "Reversed string: ".

return 0;: This line indicates that the program has executed successfully, and the main function returns 0 to the operating system, which indicates a successful execution.

When you run this program, it will prompt you to enter a string. Once you provide the input string, the program will reverse it using the reverseString function and then display the reversed string on the console.
