The code provided is a C++ program that takes an integer input from the user and then checks whether the input number is even or odd using the modulus operator (%).

Let's go through the code step-by-step:

#include <iostream>: This includes the input/output stream library, which allows the program to use standard input and output operations like std::cout and std::cin.

int main(): This is the main function where the program execution starts.

int number;: This declares an integer variable named number to store the input from the user.

std::cout << "Enter a number: ";: This line prints the message "Enter a number: " to the console, prompting the user to enter a number.

std::cin >> number;: This line reads the user's input from the console and stores it in the variable number.

if (number % 2 == 0) { ... } else { ... }: This is an if-else statement to check if the input number is even or odd. The condition number % 2 == 0 checks if the remainder of number divided by 2 is zero, which means the number is even. If it's true, the program prints "Number is even." Otherwise, it prints "Number is odd."

return 0;: This line indicates that the program has executed successfully and returns 0 to the operating system.

Overall, this program is a simple implementation of checking whether a given number is even or odd. When the program runs, it prompts the user to enter a number, and after the user provides the input, it prints whether the number is even or odd.
